# CSS Battle Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for challenges from [CSSBattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev/). 
I’m using this as a learning tool to sharpen my CSS skills and build pixel-perfect designs.

## Goals:
- Practice advanced CSS positioning and layout techniques.
- Learn by doing — some challenges are self-solved, while others are solved by learning from community solutions and resources like ChatGPT.

## Structure:
Each folder corresponds to a battle, and each file contains:
- HTML/CSS code for the challenge.
- Comments when a solution is learned from others or explored with help.

## Battles Completed:
- Battle #1 — Pilot Battle
- Battle #2 — Visibility
- Battle #3 — Cursor
- Battle #4 — Display
- Battle #5 — Inline
- Battle #6 — Conic
- Battle #7 — Backface
- Battle #8 — Transition

## Note:
This is a learning project. I believe in growing by understanding and recreating—every solution here reflects a step in that journey.
